Hello and welcome to AmitChats!
Here you can...well... Chat!

In order to start chatting, make sure a server is running in a known ip!
Once a server is running, its time to connect. open the Person file and hit run.
At moment, the person file will only open one "Person". In order to open more, just add a delay and create a new object of type person.
example:
a = person()
time.sleep(0.5)
b = person()

Once you ran the person file a page will open. 
In each section, fill up the appropriate data.
Name- Enter your name. The name has to have at least one letter, and will delete all of the none letters.
password- Enter the room password you would like to enter. If the room doesnt exist, the server will make one for you.
Host IP- Enter the ip of the server. The server will always be running on port 5555. Enter "1" in order to connect to your local host."127.0.0.1".

Great! You can now start chatting!
Here are some of the commands you can use:
PR name: msg - This command will send a message to a spacific person with that name. The person does not have to be in the same room as you!
play runner - this will open the game of runner! just for fun. Make sure to tell your friends your highest score!

Lastly-
The server will create text files in order to preserve the history of each room. No need to worry, after the room closes the text file will be deleted.
There might be a time when the data failed to get to the client.This rarly ever happends, but if it does you wont get the "SERVER says: name has entered the chat" msg. 
if that happends close the person file and try again. 

Have fun chatting!
-Amit
