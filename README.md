# Chat-Server
A chat server system with history.


With this you can make a simple clients chat server. 
The history of the chat is being written on a new textfile that will get deleted once the room is closed.
As a person, you need to add your name, the room password you want to join(If there isnt a room with this password you will open it yourself) and the server ip.
You can write PR_ "name":"message" in order to send a private message.
